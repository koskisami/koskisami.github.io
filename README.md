# koskisami.github.io
My portfolio site built with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap

## Features
- Basic, Fast, Pretty UI that is clear to read
- Information.

## Why not [insert framework here] over HTML and CSS?
Because HTML is light and I don't think that it would really benefit me or anyone else if I used React for this simple website.
